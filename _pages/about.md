Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Jheronimus Academy of Data Science](https://www.jads.nl/). I hold a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Psychology from the University of Zagreb, as well as a second Master’s degree in Brain and Cognitive Science from the University of Amsterdam. I completed my PhD (cum laude) as part of the Hybrid Intelligence Centre, as a joint collaboration between Vrije University of Amsterdam and Delft University of Technology. My PhD focused on understanding and modeling partner selection for cooperative tasks and person perceptions from everyday social interactions with the goal of creating social AI to support human interactions.

My research interest is to understand how people form social perceptions of other humans and AI, choose partners for various tasks, and how social (especially non-verbal) behaviors influence these processes. I aim to develop socially intelligent systems that can detect relevant social signals, support behavioral reflection, and assist people in making better partner choices. I study these questions in real-world interactions by integrating methods from social psychology and machine learning.
